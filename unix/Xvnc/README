=======================
Xvnc - the VNC X server
=======================

This is the top level directory for Xvnc, the VNC X server (or the X VNC
server, depending on how you look at it.)

Xvnc is based on the XFree86 3.3.2 "server only" distribution, which in turn is
based on the X11R6.3 distribution from the X consortium.

The code specific to the TurboVNC/TightVNC X server is located in the
programs/Xserver/hw/vnc directory.  The rest of the code is a cut-down
version of the standard XFree86 distribution without many of the later
X extensions or hardware-specific code.  See the file DIFFS for details
of all changes made to files from the XFree86 distribution.

Configurable Authentication
---------------------------
This version of Xvnc incorporates code which allows different authentication
methods to be selected at run time.  This code supports the standard "None" and
"VNC" authentication methods as well as methods for using one-time passwords
(OTP) and Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).

The Xvnc server will look in the authentication configuration file
(default "/etc/turbovncserver-auth.conf") at run time for authentication
configuration directives.

To enable PAM support (required for the "pam-userpwd" authentication
method), "XvncAuthPAM" must be defined at compile time.  This is the default
for Linux.  To enable or disable PAM support, #define XvncAuthPAM to YES or
NO in the platform-specific config file under config/cf.

The pam-userpwd authentication method requires the TurboVNC Viewer or another
VNC viewer that can handle the Tight security type and the Unix Login
authentication scheme.  You will also need to configure PAM as appropriate
for your system.  The default PAM service name is "turbovnc".

NOTE: interaction with PAM is limited to supplying a user name and password.
The exchange of any additional information is not supported.

See the Xvnc man page for details on the command-line options which control
configurable authentication.
