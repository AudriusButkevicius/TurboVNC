Xvnc - the VNC X server
=======================

This is the top-level directory for Xvnc, the VNC X server (or the X VNC
server, depending on how you look at it.)

TurboVNC's implementation of Xvnc was originally based on TightVNC 1.3.x, which
was based on XFree86 3.3.x, which was based on the X11R6.3 distribution from
the X consortium.  However, TurboVNC's X server also borrows significant code
from xf4vnc (based on XFree86 4.x) and from Xorg 7.1, mainly for the purpose
of implementing newer X extensions like RENDER and RANDR.

The code specific to TurboVNC is located in the programs/Xserver/hw/vnc
directory.  The rest of the code is a stripped-down version of the XFree86 and
Xorg code, including only the features necessary to support Xvnc.

Configurable Authentication
---------------------------
This version of Xvnc incorporates code that allows different authentication
methods to be selected at run time.  This code supports the standard "None" and
"VNC" authentication methods as well as methods for using one-time passwords
(OTP) and Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).

The Xvnc server will look in the authentication configuration file
(default "/etc/turbovncserver-auth.conf") at run time for authentication
configuration directives.

To enable PAM support (required for the "pam-userpwd" authentication
method), "XvncAuthPAM" must be defined at compile time.  This is the default
for Linux.  To enable or disable PAM support, #define XvncAuthPAM to YES or
NO in the platform-specific config file under config/cf.

The pam-userpwd authentication method requires the TurboVNC Viewer or another
VNC viewer that can handle the Tight security type and the Unix Login
authentication scheme.  You will also need to configure PAM as appropriate
for your system.  The default PAM service name is "turbovnc".

NOTE: interaction with PAM is limited to supplying a user name and password.
The exchange of any additional information is not supported.

See the Xvnc man page for details on the command-line options that control
configurable authentication.
