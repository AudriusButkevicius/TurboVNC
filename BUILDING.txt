*******************************************************************************
**     Building TurboVNC
*******************************************************************************


==================
Build Requirements
==================


All Systems
-----------

-- CMake (http://www.cmake.org) v2.8.4 or later

-- libjpeg-turbo SDK v1.0.0 or later (v1.3 or later required if building the
   Java viewer.)
   * The libjpeg-turbo SDK binary packages can be downloaded from the "Files"
     area of http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/
   * The TurboVNC build system will search for the TurboJPEG header and
     library under /opt/libjpeg-turbo on Unix or c:\libjpeg-turbo[64] on
     Windows, but you can override this by setting the TJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR CMake
     variable to the directory containing turbojpeg.h and the TJPEG_LIBRARY
     CMake variable to the full path of the TurboJPEG library against which
     you want to link.


Linux and other Un*x O/S's (except Mac)
---------------------------------------

-- rsync (if building the TurboVNC Server using an out-of-tree build)

-- GCC

-- X Intrinsics/Athena Widgets development kit
   * libXaw, libXt, and all dependencies thereof

-- libXcursor development kit

-- PAM development kit (if building the TurboVNC Server)


Windows
-------

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 or later

   If you don't already have Visual C++, then the easiest way to get it is by
   installing the Windows SDK:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx

   The Windows SDK includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ compilers and
   everything necessary to build TurboVNC.

   * For 32-bit builds, you can also use Microsoft Visual C++ Express
     Edition.  Visual C++ Express Edition is a free download.
   * If you intend to build TurboVNC from the command line, then add the
     appropriate compiler and SDK directories to the INCLUDE, LIB, and PATH
     environment variables.  This is generally accomplished by executing
     vcvars32.bat or vcvars64.bat and SetEnv.cmd.  vcvars32.bat and
     vcvars64.bat are part of Visual C++ and are located in the same directory
     as the compiler.  SetEnv.cmd is part of the Windows SDK.  You can pass
     optional arguments to SetEnv.cmd to specify a 32-bit or 64-bit build
     environment.


Mac/Java
--------

-- JDK or OpenJDK 1.5 or later (1.6 or later recommended)
   * On OS X 10.5 and later, install the Java Developer Package, which can
     be downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/downloads (Apple ID
     required)
   * For systems that do not provide a JDK, download the Oracle Java
     Development Kit from http://www.java.com


==================
Out-of-Tree Builds
==================

Binary objects, libraries, and executables are generated in the same directory
from which CMake was executed (the "binary directory"), and this directory need
not necessarily be the same as the TurboVNC source directory.  You can create
multiple independent binary directories, in which different versions of
TurboVNC can be built from the same source tree using different compilers or
settings.  In the sections below, {build_directory} refers to the binary
directory, whereas {source_directory} refers to the TurboVNC source directory.
For in-tree builds, these directories are the same.


===============
Build Procedure
===============


Un*x (including Mac)
--------------------

The following procedure will build the TurboVNC Viewer and (if the TurboVNC
Server build is enabled) a handful of C applications that are used to interface
with the TurboVNC Server.  On most 64-bit systems (Solaris being a notable
exception), this will build a 64-bit version of TurboVNC.  See "Build Recipes"
for specific instructions on how to build a 32-bit or 64-bit version of
TurboVNC on systems that support both.

On Mac, this builds the Java TurboVNC Viewer by default.  If you want to build
the native (X11) TurboVNC Viewer instead, then pass
'-DTVNC_BUILDNATIVE=1 -DTVNC_BUILDJAVA=0' to CMake.

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" [additional CMake flags] {source_directory}
  make

On supported platforms (Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD, at the moment), the
TurboVNC Server (Xvnc) can then be built by executing:

  make xserver

You can also run:

  make xserver-clean

to clean the Xvnc build, or

  make xserver-rebuild

to do a minimal rebuild of Xvnc without re-configuring it.


Visual C++ (Command Line)
-------------------------

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [additional CMake flags] {source_directory}
  nmake

This will build either a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of TurboVNC, depending on
which version of cl.exe is in the PATH.


Visual C++ (IDE)
----------------

Choose the appropriate CMake generator option for your version of Visual Studio
(run "cmake" with no arguments for a list of available generators.)  For
instance:

  cd {build_directory}
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" [additional CMake flags] {source_directory}

You can then open ALL_BUILD.vcproj in Visual Studio and build one of the
configurations in that project ("Debug", "Release", etc.) to generate a full
build of TurboVNC.


Java
----

Adding -DTVNC_BUILDJAVA=1 to the CMake command line will build the Java
TurboVNC Viewer, as well as include it when installing or packaging the native
TurboVNC Viewer or the TurboVNC Server.  This is the default on Mac platforms.

Additionally, you can build the Java TurboVNC Viewer without building the
native code.  Simply use {source_directory}/java as the source directory for
CMake.


===========
Debug Build
===========

When building the native TurboVNC Viewer or the TurboVNC Server, add
"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" to the CMake command line.  Or, if building with
NMake, remove "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" (Debug builds are the default with
NMake.)


=============
Build Recipes
=============


32-bit Build on 64-bit Linux/Unix
---------------------------------

Use export/setenv to set the following environment variables before running
CMake:

  CFLAGS=-m32
  LDFLAGS=-m32


64-bit Build on Solaris
-----------------------

Use export/setenv to set the following environment variables before running
CMake:

  CFLAGS=-m64
  LDFLAGS=-m64


Compilers Other Than GCC
------------------------

On Un*x systems, prior to running CMake, you can set the CC environment
variable to the command used to invoke the C compiler.


*******************************************************************************
**     Advanced CMake Options
*******************************************************************************

To list and configure other CMake options not specifically mentioned in this
guide, run

  ccmake {source_directory}

or

  cmake-gui {source_directory}

after initially configuring the build.  CCMake is a text-based interactive
version of CMake, and CMake-GUI is a GUI version.  Both will display all
variables that are relevant to the TurboVNC build, their current values, and a
help string describing what they do.


*******************************************************************************
**     Installing TurboVNC
*******************************************************************************

You can use the build system to install TurboVNC into a directory of your
choosing.  To do this, add:

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={install_directory}

to the CMake command line.  Then, you can run 'make install' or 'nmake install'
(or build the "install" target in the Visual Studio IDE) to build the TurboVNC
Viewer and install TurboVNC.  Running 'make uninstall' or 'nmake uninstall' (or
building the "uninstall" target in the Visual Studio IDE) will uninstall
TurboVNC.

If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, then the default is
c:\Program Files\TurboVNC on Windows and /opt/TurboVNC on Unix.


*******************************************************************************
**     Creating Release Packages
*******************************************************************************

The following commands can be used to create various types of release packages:


====
Unix
====

make rpm

  Create Red Hat-style binary RPM package.  Requires RPM v4 or later.

make deb

  Create Debian-style binary package.  Requires dpkg.

make dmg

  Create Macintosh package/disk image.  This requires the PackageMaker
  application, which the build system looks for in
  /Developer/Applications/Utilities by default.  You can override this by
  setting the PACKAGEMAKER_PATH CMake variable.  Note that PackageMaker is not
  included in recent releases of Xcode, but it can be obtained by downloading
  the "Auxiliary Tools for Xcode" package from
  http://developer.apple.com/downloads.


=======
Windows
=======

If using NMake:

  cd {build_directory}
  nmake installer

If using the Visual Studio IDE, build the "installer" project.

The installer package (TurboVNC[64]-{version}.exe) will be located under
{build_directory}.  If building using the Visual Studio IDE, then the installer
package will be located in a subdirectory with the same name as the
configuration you built (such as {build_directory}\Debug\ or
{build_directory}\Release\).

Building a Windows installer requires Inno Setup
(http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).  iscc.exe should be in your PATH.
