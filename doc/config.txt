* Advanced Configuration

** Server Settings

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_ALRALL = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable automatic lossless refresh for regions that were \
drawn using X11 functions other than ''X[Shm]PutImage()'' |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": ALR}

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_ALRCOPYRECT = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable automatic lossless refresh for regions that were \
drawn using CopyRect |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": ALR}

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_COMBINERECT = ''__''{c}''__ |
| Summary | Combine framebuffer updates with more than __''{c}''__ rectangles \
into a single rectangle spanning the bounding box of all of the constituent \
rectangles |
| Default Value | 100 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Applications can sometimes draw many thousands of points or
	tiny lines using individual X11 calls, and this can cause the VNC server to
	send many	thousands of tiny rectangles to the VNC viewer.  The overhead
	associated with this can bog down the viewer, and in extreme cases, the
	number of rectangles may even exceed the maximum number that is allowed in a
	single framebuffer update (65534.)  Thus, if a framebuffer update contains
	more than __''{c}''__ rectangles, TurboVNC will coalesce it into a single
	rectangle that covers all of the rectangles in the update.  For applications
	that generate many tiny rectangles, increasing ''TVNC_COMBINERECT'' may
	significantly increase the number of pixels sent to the viewer, which will
	increase network usage.  However, for those same applications, lowering
	''TVNC_COMBINERECT'' will increase the number of rectangles sent to the
	viewer, which will increase the CPU usage of both the server and the viewer.

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_IFDEBUG = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable the ICE debugger |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If interframe comparison is enabled (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": InterframeComparison}), then setting this environment
	variable to 1 will cause the interframe comparison engine (ICE) to change the
	color of duplicate screen regions without culling them from the update stream.  This
	allows you to easily see which applications are generating duplicate updates.

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_MT = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable multithreaded image encoding |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_NTHREADS = ''__''{n}''__ |
| Summary | Use __''{n}''__ threads to perform image encoding |
| Default Value | __''{n}''__ = the number of CPU cores in the system |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_PROFILE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then the TurboVNC Server will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipeline to the Xvnc log file.

** Client Settings

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_PROFILE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Platforms | X11, Mac/Java |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then the TurboVNC Viewer will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipeline to the console.

** Java Client Settings

| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.lionfs = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable the use of the OS X full-screen application feature |
| Default Value | Enabled if running on OS X 10.7 or later |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When running in full-screen mode, the Java TurboVNC Viewer
	will normally try to take advantage of the full-screen application feature
	provided by OS X 10.7 and later, if available.  Disabling this property will
	force the viewer to use its own built-in cross-platform "pseudo-full-screen"
	feature instead.  This is useful mainly for testing.

| Java System Property | ''turbovnc.turbojpeg = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable JPEG acceleration |
| Default Value | Enabled if the libjpeg-turbo JNI library is available |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, the Java TurboVNC Viewer will try to load the
	libjpeg-turbo JNI library and use it to accelerate the decompression of
	JPEG subrectangles.  If this property is disabled, then the viewer will
	revert to using unaccelerated JPEG decompression.  This is useful mainly for
	testing and benchmarking purposes.
